We introduce Flamingo, a family of Visual Language Models (VLM) with this ability. Flamingo models include key architectural innovations to: (i) bridge powerful pretrained vision-only and language-only models, (ii) handle sequences…
Jean-Baptiste Alayrac#Look for the Change: Learning Object States and State-Modifying Actions from Untrimmed Web Videos#"Human actions often induce changes of object states such as ""cutting an apple"", ""cleaning shoes"" or ""pouring coffee"". In this paper, we seek to temporally localize object states (e.g. ""empty"" and ""full"" cup) together with the corresponding state-modifying actions (""pouring coffee"") in long uncurated videos with minimal supervision. The contributions of this work are threefold. First, we develop a…"
Jean-Baptiste Alayrac#General-purpose, long-context autoregressive modeling with Perceiver AR#Real-world data is high-dimensional: a book, image, or musical performance can easily contain hundreds of thousands of elements even after compression. However, the most commonly used autoregressive models, Transformers, are prohibitively expensive to scale to the number of inputs and layers needed to capture this long-range structure. We develop Perceiver AR, an autoregressive, modality-agnostic…

Jean-Baptiste Alayrac#Perceiver IO: A General Architecture for Structured Inputs & Outputs#A central goal of machine learning is the development of systems that can solve many problems in as many data domains as possible. Current architectures, however, cannot be applied beyond a small set of stereotyped settings, as they bake in domain & task assumptions or scale poorly to large inputs or outputs. In this work, we propose Perceiver IO, a general-purpose architecture that handles data f…
Jean-Baptiste Alayrac#Generative Art Using Neural Visual Grammars and Dual Encoders#Whilst there are perhaps only a few scientific methods, there seem to be almost as many artistic methods as there are artists. Artistic processes appear to inhabit the highest order of open-endedness. To begin to understand some of the processes of art making it is helpful to try to automate them even partially. In this paper, a novel algorithm for producing generative art is described which allow…
Jean-Baptiste Alayrac#Multimodal Self-Supervised Learning of General Audio Representations#We present a multimodal framework to learn general audio representations from videos. Existing contrastive audio representation learning methods mainly focus on using the audio modality alone during training. In this work, we show that additional information contained in video can be utilized to greatly improve the learned features. First, we demonstrate that our contrastive framework does not req…
Jean-Baptiste Alayrac#Machine Translation Decoding beyond Beam Search#Beam search is the go-to method for decoding auto-regressive machine translation models. While it yields consistent improvements in terms of BLEU, it is only concerned with finding outputs with high model likelihood, and is thus agnostic to whatever end metric or score practitioners care about. Our aim is to establish whether beam search can be replaced by a more powerful metric-driven search tech…
Jean-Baptiste Alayrac#Broaden Your Views for Self-Supervised Video Learning#Most successful self-supervised learning methods are trained to align the representations of two independent views from the data. State-of-the-art methods in video are inspired by image techniques, where these two views are similarly extracted by cropping and augmenting the resulting crop. However, these methods miss a crucial element in the video domain: time. We introduce BraVe, a self-supervise…
Jean-Baptiste Alayrac#Thinking Fast and Slow: Efficient Text-to-Visual Retrieval with Transformers#Our objective is language-based search of large-scale image and video datasets. For this task, the approach that consists of independently mapping text and vision to a joint embedding space, a.k.a. dual encoders, is attractive as retrieval scales and is efficient for billions of images using approximate nearest neighbour search. An alternative approach of using vision-text transformers with cross-…
Jean-Baptiste Alayrac#Efficient Visual Pretraining with Contrastive Detection#Self-supervised pretraining has been shown to yield powerful representations for transfer learning. These performance gains come at a large computational cost however, with state-of-the-art methods requiring an order of magnitude more computation than supervised pretraining. We tackle this computational bottleneck by introducing a new self-supervised objective, contrastive detection, which tasks r…
Jean-Baptiste Alayrac#Decoupling the Role of Data, Attention, and Losses in Multimodal Transformers#Recently multimodal transformer models have gained popularity because their performance on language and vision tasks suggest they learn rich visual-linguistic representations. Focusing on zero-shot image retrieval tasks, we study three important factors which can impact the quality of learned representations: pretraining data, the attention mechanism, and loss functions. By pretraining models on s…

It contains 122 different actions which were obtained by comb…"
Jean-Baptiste Alayrac#Self-Supervised MultiModal Versatile Networks#Videos are a rich source of multi-modal supervision. In this work, we learn representations using self-supervision by leveraging three modalities naturally present in videos: visual, audio and language streams. To this end, we introduce the notion of a multimodal versatile network -- a network that can ingest multiple modalities and whose representations enable downstream tasks in multiple modalit…
Jean-Baptiste Alayrac#Learning to Segment Actions from Observation and Narration#We apply a generative segmental model of task structure, guided by narration, to action segmentation in video. We focus on unsupervised and weakly-supervised settings where no action labels are known during training.

In this work we propose a new learning approach, MIL-NCE, capable of addressing misalignments inherent to narra…

We make the following three contributions: (i) we introduce a new structured neural network architecture that explicitly incorporates layers (as spatial masks) into its desig…
Jean-Baptiste Alayrac#HowTo100M: Learning a Text-Video Embedding by Watching Hundred Million Narrated Video Clips#Learning text-video embeddings usually requires a dataset of video clips with manually provided captions. However, such datasets are expensive and time consuming to create and therefore difficult to obtain on a large scale. In this work, we propose instead to learn such embeddings from video data with readily available natural language annotations in the form of automatically transcribed narration…
Jean-Baptiste Alayrac#Are Labels Required for Improving Adversarial Robustness?#Recent work has uncovered the interesting (and somewhat surprising) finding that training models to be invariant to adversarial perturbations requires substantially larger datasets than those required for standard classification. This result is a key hurdle in the deployment of robust machine learning models in many real world applications where labeled data is expensive. Our main insight is that…
Jean-Baptiste Alayrac#Cross-task weakly supervised learning from instructional videos#In this paper we investigate learning visual models for the steps of ordinary tasks using weak supervision via instructional narrations and an ordered list of steps instead of strong supervision via temporal annotations. At the heart of our approach is the observation that weakly supervised learning may be easier if a model shares components while learning different steps: `pour egg' should be tra…

Layered video representations have the potential of accurately modelling realistic scenes but have so far required stringent as…

In this work we propose a unifying framework that can handle and combine varying types of less-demand…

Given a set of videos for a particular task, we propose a joint model that learns to identif…

The key intuition behind our improvements is that the estimates of block gaps maintained by BCFW reveal the bl…

This, in turn, not only hinders automated knowledge aggregation, but also the perception of displayed in-formation for visually impair…
