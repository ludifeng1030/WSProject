NeurMiPs: Neural Mixture of Planar Experts for View Synthesis#Zhi-Hao Lin, Wei-Chiu Ma, Hao-Yu Hsu, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, Shenlong Wang#"We present Neural Mixtures of Planar Experts (NeurMiPs), a novel planar-based
scene representation for modeling geometry and appearance. NeurMiPs leverages a
collection of local planar experts in 3D space as the scene representation.
Each planar expert consists of the parameters of the local rectangular shape
representing geometry and a neural radiance field modeling the color and
opacity. We render novel views by calculating ray-plane intersections and
composite output colors and densities at intersected points to the image.
NeurMiPs blends the efficiency of explicit mesh rendering and flexibility of
the neural radiance field. Experiments demonstrate superior performance and
speed of our proposed method, compared to other 3D representations in novel
view synthesis."#CVPR 2022. Project page: this https URL#computer science#computing research repository#computer vision and pattern recognition
HuMMan: Multi-Modal 4D Human Dataset for Versatile Sensing and Modeling#Zhongang Cai, Daxuan Ren, Ailing Zeng, Zhengyu Lin, Tao Yu, Wenjia Wang, Xiangyu Fan, Yang Gao, Yifan Yu, Liang Pan, Fangzhou Hong, Mingyuan Zhang, Chen Change Loy, Lei Yang, Ziwei Liu#"4D human sensing and modeling are fundamental tasks in vision and graphics
with numerous applications. With the advances of new sensors and algorithms,
there is an increasing demand for more versatile datasets. In this work, we
contribute HuMMan, a large-scale multi-modal 4D human dataset with 1000 human
subjects, 400k sequences and 60M frames. HuMMan has several appealing
properties: 1) multi-modal data and annotations including color images, point
clouds, keypoints, SMPL parameters, and textured meshes; 2) popular mobile
device is included in the sensor suite; 3) a set of 500 actions, designed to
cover fundamental movements; 4) multiple tasks such as action recognition, pose
estimation, parametric human recovery, and textured mesh reconstruction are
supported and evaluated. Extensive experiments on HuMMan voice the need for
further study on challenges such as fine-grained action recognition, dynamic
human mesh reconstruction, point cloud-based parametric human recovery, and
cross-device domain gaps."#Homepage: this https URL#computer science#computing research repository#computer vision and pattern recognition
Unified Simulation, Perception, and Generation of Human Behavior#Ye Yuan#"Understanding and modeling human behavior is fundamental to almost any
computer vision and robotics applications that involve humans. In this thesis,
we take a holistic approach to human behavior modeling and tackle its three
essential aspects -- simulation, perception, and generation. Throughout the
thesis, we show how the three aspects are deeply connected and how utilizing
and improving one aspect can greatly benefit the other aspects. We also discuss
the lessons learned and our vision for what is next for human behavior
modeling."#PhD thesis#computer science#computing research repository#computer vision and pattern recognition
Articulated Objects in Free-form Hand Interaction#Zicong Fan, Omid Taheri, Dimitrios Tzionas, Muhammed Kocabas, Manuel Kaufmann, Michael J. Black, Otmar Hilliges#"We use our hands to interact with and to manipulate objects. Articulated
objects are especially interesting since they often require the full dexterity
of human hands to manipulate them. To understand, model, and synthesize such
interactions, automatic and robust methods that reconstruct hands and
articulated objects in 3D from a color image are needed. Existing methods for
estimating 3D hand and object pose from images focus on rigid objects. In part,
because such methods rely on training data and no dataset of articulated object
manipulation exists. Consequently, we introduce ARCTIC - the first dataset of
free-form interactions of hands and articulated objects. ARCTIC has 1.2M images
paired with accurate 3D meshes for both hands and for objects that move and
deform over time. The dataset also provides hand-object contact information. To
show the value of our dataset, we perform two novel tasks on ARCTIC: (1) 3D
reconstruction of two hands and an articulated object in interaction; (2) an
estimation of dense hand-object relative distances, which we call interaction
field estimation. For the first task, we present ArcticNet, a baseline method
for the task of jointly reconstructing two hands and an articulated object from
an RGB image. For interaction field estimation, we predict the relative
distances from each hand vertex to the object surface, and vice versa. We
introduce InterField, the first method that estimates such distances from a
single RGB image. We provide qualitative and quantitative experiments for both
tasks, and provide detailed analysis on the data. Code and data will be
available at this https URL."##computer science#computing research repository#computer vision and pattern recognition
Unsupervised Multi-Modal Medical Image Registration via Discriminator-Free Image-to-Image Translation#Zekang Chen, Jia Wei, Rui Li#"In clinical practice, well-aligned multi-modal images, such as Magnetic
Resonance (MR) and Computed Tomography (CT), together can provide complementary
information for image-guided therapies. Multi-modal image registration is
essential for the accurate alignment of these multi-modal images. However, it
remains a very challenging task due to complicated and unknown spatial
correspondence between different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel
translation-based unsupervised deformable image registration approach to
convert the multi-modal registration problem to a mono-modal one. Specifically,
our approach incorporates a discriminator-free translation network to
facilitate the training of the registration network and a patchwise contrastive
loss to encourage the translation network to preserve object shapes.
Furthermore, we propose to replace an adversarial loss, that is widely used in
previous multi-modal image registration methods, with a pixel loss in order to
integrate the output of translation into the target modality. This leads to an
unsupervised method requiring no ground-truth deformation or pairs of aligned
images for training. We evaluate four variants of our approach on the public
Learn2Reg 2021 datasets \cite{hering2021learn2reg}. The experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art
performance. Our code is available at this https URL."#Accepted in IJCAI 2022#computer science#computing research repository#computer vision and pattern recognition
Schrödinger's FP: Dynamic Adaptation of Floating-Point Containers for Deep Learning Training#Miloš Nikolić, Enrique Torres Sanchez, Jiahui Wang, Ali Hadi Zadeh, Mostafa Mahmoud, Ameer Abdelhadi, Andreas Moshovos#"We introduce a software-hardware co-design approach to reduce memory traffic
and footprint during training with BFloat16 or FP32 boosting energy efficiency
and execution time performance. We introduce methods to dynamically adjust the
size and format of the floating-point containers used to store activations and
weights during training. The different value distributions lead us to different
approaches for exponents and mantissas. Gecko exploits the favourable exponent
distribution with a loss-less delta encoding approach to reduce the total
exponent footprint by up to $58\%$ in comparison to a 32 bit floating point
baseline. To content with the noisy mantissa distributions, we present two
lossy methods to eliminate as many as possible least significant bits while not
affecting accuracy. Quantum Mantissa, is a machine learning-first mantissa
compression method that taps on training's gradient descent algorithm to also
learn minimal mantissa bitlengths on a per-layer granularity, and obtain up to
$92\%$ reduction in total mantissa footprint. Alternatively, BitChop observes
changes in the loss function during training to adjust mantissa bit-length
network-wide yielding a reduction of $81\%$ in footprint. Schrödinger's FP
implements hardware encoders/decoders that guided by Gecko/Quantum Mantissa or
Gecko/BitChop transparently encode/decode values when transferring to/from
off-chip memory boosting energy efficiency and reducing execution time."##computer science#computing research repository#machine learning
Toward Compositional Generalization in Object-Oriented World Modeling#Linfeng Zhao, Lingzhi Kong, Robin Walters, Lawson L.S. Wong#"Compositional generalization is a critical ability in learning and
decision-making. We focus on the setting of reinforcement learning in
object-oriented environments to study compositional generalization in world
modeling. We (1) formalize the compositional generalization problem with an
algebraic approach and (2) study how a world model can achieve that. We
introduce a conceptual environment, Object Library, and two instances, and
deploy a principled pipeline to measure the generalization ability. Motivated
by the formulation, we analyze several methods with exact} or no compositional
generalization ability using our framework, and design a differentiable
approach, Homomorphic Object-oriented World Model (HOWM), that achieves
approximate but more efficient compositional generalization."##computer science#computing research repository#machine learning
Unlocking High-Accuracy Differentially Private Image Classification through Scale#Soham De, Leonard Berrada, Jamie Hayes, Samuel L. Smith, Borja Balle#"Differential Privacy (DP) provides a formal privacy guarantee preventing
adversaries with access to a machine learning model from extracting information
about individual training points. Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient
Descent (DP-SGD), the most popular DP training method, realizes this protection
by injecting noise during training. However previous works have found that
DP-SGD often leads to a significant degradation in performance on standard
image classification benchmarks. Furthermore, some authors have postulated that
DP-SGD inherently performs poorly on large models, since the norm of the noise
required to preserve privacy is proportional to the model dimension. In
contrast, we demonstrate that DP-SGD on over-parameterized models can perform
significantly better than previously thought. Combining careful hyper-parameter
tuning with simple techniques to ensure signal propagation and improve the
convergence rate, we obtain a new SOTA on CIFAR-10 of 81.4% under (8,
10^{-5})-DP using a 40-layer Wide-ResNet, improving over the previous SOTA of
71.7%. When fine-tuning a pre-trained 200-layer Normalizer-Free ResNet, we
achieve a remarkable 77.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet under (1, 8*10^{-7})-DP,
and achieve 81.1% under (8, 8*10^{-7})-DP. This markedly exceeds the previous
SOTA of 47.9% under a larger privacy budget of (10, 10^{-6})-DP. We believe our
results are a significant step towards closing the accuracy gap between private
and non-private image classification."##computer science#computing research repository#machine learning
Standardized Evaluation of Machine Learning Methods for Evolving Data Streams#Johannes Haug, Effi Tramountani, Gjergji Kasneci#"Due to the unspecified and dynamic nature of data streams, online machine
learning requires powerful and flexible solutions. However, evaluating online
machine learning methods under realistic conditions is difficult. Existing work
therefore often draws on different heuristics and simulations that do not
necessarily produce meaningful and reliable results. Indeed, in the absence of
common evaluation standards, it often remains unclear how online learning
methods will perform in practice or in comparison to similar work. In this
paper, we propose a comprehensive set of properties for high-quality machine
learning in evolving data streams. In particular, we discuss sensible
performance measures and evaluation strategies for online predictive modelling,
online feature selection and concept drift detection. As one of the first
works, we also look at the interpretability of online learning methods. The
proposed evaluation standards are provided in a new Python framework called
float. Float is completely modular and allows the simultaneous integration of
common libraries, such as scikit-multiflow or river, with custom code. Float is
open-sourced and can be accessed at this https URL. In this
sense, we hope that our work will contribute to more standardized, reliable and
realistic testing and comparison of online machine learning methods."##computer science#computing research repository#machine learning
Personalized Federated Learning with Multiple Known Clusters#Boxiang Lyu, Filip Hanzely, Mladen Kolar#"We consider the problem of personalized federated learning when there are
known cluster structures within users. An intuitive approach would be to
regularize the parameters so that users in the same cluster share similar model
weights. The distances between the clusters can then be regularized to reflect
the similarity between different clusters of users. We develop an algorithm
that allows each cluster to communicate independently and derive the
convergence results. We study a hierarchical linear model to theoretically
demonstrate that our approach outperforms agents learning independently and
agents learning a single shared weight. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages
of our approach using both simulated and real-world data."##computer science#computing research repository#machine learning
Single G centers in silicon fabricated by co-implantation with carbon and proton#Yoann Baron, Alrik Durand, Tobias Herzig, Mario Khoury, Sébastien Pezzagna, Jan Meijer, Isabelle Robert-Philip, Marco Abbarchi, Jean-Michel Hartmann, Shay Reboh, Jean-Michel Gérard, Vincent Jacques, Guillaume Cassabois, Anaïs Dréau#"We report the fabrication of G centers in silicon with an areal density
compatible with single photon emission at optical telecommunication
wavelengths. Our sample is made from a silicon-on-insulator wafer which is
locally implanted with carbon ions and protons at various fluences. Decreasing
the implantation fluences enables to gradually switch from large ensembles to
isolated single defects, reaching areal densities of G centers down to
$\sim$0.2 $\mu$m$^{-2}$. Single defect creation is demonstrated by photon
antibunching in intensity-correlation experiments, thus establishing our
approach as a reproducible procedure for generating single artificial atoms in
silicon for quantum technologies."##physics#physics#applied physics
Practical Analysis of Permeable Concrete Properties with Polypropylene Fiber Addition#Rebeca de M. Kich, Victor A. Kich, Kelvin I. Seibt#"One of the recent approaches used to minimize the impacts of the growth of
impermeable areas in urban centers is permeable flooring. Permeable floors can
be made of concrete and are called permeable concrete. This research aims to
analyze the use of polypropylene fibers in the mixture of permeable concrete to
assess whether the fibers significantly alter the properties of this type of
concrete, such as compression resistance and flexure tensile strength. For the
tests, three concrete mixes of permeable concrete were first used to determine
the reference of the composition of concrete: 1:3, without the use of sand and
with water-to-cement ratio (w/c) equal to 0.32; 1:4, with the use of 10\% of
coarse sand and w/c of 0.35; and finally 1:5, with the use of 10\% of coarse
sand and w/c of 0.35; and finally 1:5, using 10\% of coarse sand and w/c of
0.35. In these concrete mixes, tests were performed to determine their
mechanical properties being them: permeability, compression resistance, and
flexure tensile strength. After the reference concrete mix was determined,
three more concrete mixes were made using polypropylene fibers, at levels of
0.6 kg/m$^3$, 1.8 kg/m$^3$, and 3.0 kg/m$^3$. The same initial tests were then
carried out for concrete with the addition of fibers. The analysis of the
results showed that the concrete mix that achieved the best result for the
flexure tensile strength test, which was the main focus of the research, was
the 1:4 trait with the addition of 1.8 kg/m$^3$."##physics#physics#applied physics
Random number generation with a chaotic electromechanical resonator#Guilhem Madiot, Franck Correia, Sylvain Barbay, Rémy Braive#"Chaos enables the emergence of randomness in deterministic physical systems.
Therefore it can be exploited for the conception of true random number
generators (RNG) mandatory in classical cryptography applications. Meanwhile,
nanomechanical oscillators, at the core of many on-board functionalities such
as sensing, reveal as excellent candidates to behave chaotically. This is made
possible thanks to intrinsic mechanical nonlinearities emerging at the
nanoscale. Here we present a platform gathering a nanomechanical oscillator and
its integrated capacitive actuation. Using a modulation of the resonant force
induced by the electrodes, we demonstrate chaotic dynamics and study how it
depends on the dissipation of the system. The randomness of a binary sequence
generated from a chaotic time trace is evaluated and discussed such that the
generic parameters enabling successful random number generation can be
established. This demonstration makes use of concepts which are sufficiently
general to be applied to the next generation of nano-electro-optomechanical
systems."#8 pages, 5 figures#physics#physics#applied physics
Machine learning for knowledge acquisition and accelerated inverse-design for non-Hermitian systems#W. W. Ahmed, M. Farhat, K. Staliunas, X. Zhang, Y. Wu#"Non-Hermitian systems offer new platforms for unusual physical properties
that can be flexibly manipulated by redistribution of the real and imaginary
parts of refractive indices, whose presence breaks conventional wave
propagation symmetries, leading to asymmetric reflection and symmetric
transmission with respect to the wave propagation direction. Here, we use
supervised and unsupervised learning techniques for knowledge acquisition in
non-Hermitian systems which accelerate the inverse design process. In
particular, we construct a deep learning model that relates the transmission
and asymmetric reflection in non-conservative settings and proposes
sub-manifold learning to recognize non-Hermitian features from transmission
spectra. The developed deep learning framework determines the feasibility of a
desired spectral response for a given structure and uncovers the role of
effective gain-loss parameters to tailor the spectral response. These findings
pave the way for intelligent inverse design and shape our understanding of the
physical mechanism in general non-Hermitian systems."##physics#physics#applied physics
Interplay of the disorder and strain in gallium oxide#Alexander Azarov, Vishnukanthan Venkatachalapathy, Platon Karaseov, Andrei Titov, Konstantin Karabeshkin, Andrei Struchkov, Andrej Kuznetsov#"We observed an interesting interplay between the disorder and strain in
gallium oxide by comparing atomic and cluster ion irradiations as well as
atomic ions co-implants. Firstly, we demonstrated that the disorder
accumulation in gallium oxide exhibits superlinear behavior as a function of
the collision cascade density. Moreover, the level of strain correlated with
the amplitude of the bulk disorder peak can be engineered by changing the
disorder conditions in the near surface layer. Such interplay between the
disorder and strain provides an additional degree of freedom to maintain
desirable strain in gallium oxide, potentially applicable to modify the rate of
the polymorphic transitions in this material."##physics#physics#applied physics
The minimal Archimedean order unitization of seminormed ordered vector spaces#Josse van Dobben de Bruyn#"Archimedean order unit (AOU) spaces have many favourable properties, so it is
useful to have ways of turning a general ordered vector space into an AOU
space. One such construction is given by the Archimedeanization of Paulsen and
Tomforde, provided that the original space already has order units. In this
paper, we give a different construction, which assumes the presence of a
seminorm instead of an order unit. We show that our order unitization is
minimal, by showing that it satisfies a universal property similar to that of
the Archimedeanization of Paulsen and Tomforde. Additionally, we study the
properties of our unitization, and show that it agrees on the self-adjoint part
of a non-unital $C^*$-algebra with the $C^*$-algebraic unitization."#15 pages#mathematics#mathematics#functional analysis
Spectral measures with arbitrary dimensions#Zhi-Yi Wu, Yu-Liang Wu#"It is known [Dai and Sun, J. Funct. Anal. 268 (2015), 2464--2477] that there
exist spectral measures with arbitrary Hausdorff dimensions, and it is natural
to pose the question of whether similar phenomena occur for other dimensions of
spectral measures. In this paper, we first obtain the formulae of Assouad
dimension and of lower dimension for a class of Moran measures in dimension one
that is introduced by An and He [J. Funct. Anal. 266 (2014), 343--354]. Based
on these results, we show the existence of spectral measures with arbitrary
Assound dimensions $\dim_A$ and lower dimensions $\dim_L$ ranging from $0$ to
$1$, including non-atomic zero-dimensional spectral measures and
one-dimensional singular spectral measures, and prove that the two values may
coincide. In fact, more is obtained that for any $0 \leq t \leq s \leq r \leq
u\leq 1$, there exists a spectral measure $\mu$ such that \[\dim_L \mu=t,
\dim_H \mu=s, \dim_P\mu=r~ \text{and} \dim_A\mu=u,\] where $\dim_H$ and
$\dim_P$ denote the Hausdorff dimension and packing dimension of the measure
$\mu$, respectively. This result improves and generalizes the result of Dai and
Sun more simply and flexibly."##mathematics#mathematics#functional analysis
Frequently recurrence properties and block families#Rodrigo Cardeccia, Santiago Muro#"We study recurrence and the related (weaker form of recurrence) $\mathscr
P_\mathcal F$ property for linear operators on Banach spaces and for general
hereditarily upward families. We show that for special families, called block
families, hypercyclic operators with the $\mathscr P_\mathcal F$ are $\mathcal
F$-hypercyclic. Reciprocally, if $b\mathcal F$ is the block family of a given
family $\mathcal F$, adjoint operators that are $b\mathcal F$-hypercyclic have
the $\mathscr P_\mathcal F$ property. As a consequence, we are able to answer
an open question about the existence of reiteratively hypercyclic operators. We
also characterize backward shift operators with the $\mathscr P_\mathcal F$
property."##mathematics#mathematics#functional analysis
Transfinite almost square Banach spaces#Antonio Avilés, Stefano Ciaci, Johann Langemets, Aleksei Lissitsin, Abraham Rueda Zoca#"It is known that a Banach space contains an isomorphic copy of $c_0$ if, and
only if, it can be equivalently renormed to be almost square. We introduce and
study transfinite versions of almost square Banach spaces with the purpose to
relate them to the containment of isomorphic copies of $c_0(\kappa)$, where
$\kappa$ is some uncountable cardinal. We also provide several examples and
stability results of the above properties by taking direct sums, tensor
products and ultraproducts. By connecting the above properties with transfinite
analogues of the strong diameter two property and octahedral norms, we obtain a
solution to an open question from [8]."#23 Pages#mathematics#mathematics#functional analysis
